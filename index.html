    <h1 id= "title" >Taxes and Turmoil: Pay Large, Earn Small</h1>

    <h3 id= "yap">While the minimum wage sits at 7.25$ an hour, average rent prices are a staggering 1,535$ as of August 2024. These high prices are also on gas, insurance, and groceries. On top of that, many goods and services today are also taxed. Compared to England's riot worthy tax on tea, Americans are paying far more with low wages to foot the bill. Libraries, parks, schools, and other public amenities need tax money, but is that really worth 4.4 trillion in revenue?</h3>
